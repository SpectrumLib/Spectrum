# ![logo](Resources/Logo/Thumbnail.png) Spectrum [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SpectrumLib/Spectrum.svg?branch=core3)](https://travis-ci.org/SpectrumLib/Spectrum/branches)

*Note: This library is still in active development, and is not currently in a useable state.*

This branch is specifically for moving the project over from a .NET Standard 2.0 library to a .NET Core 3.0 library.

## Why LGPLv3?
The authors of the library chose LGPLv3 as the license for the project because it is a weak copyleft library-level license. This license forces direct modifications of the library to be made open source under the same license. However, projects that only link against this library can be made closed source, commercialized, and re-licensed as their authors seem fit. **In short, if you are:**

* *modifying the Spectrum source directly* - you must open source your modifications under LGPL v3.
* *writing a library or application using Spectrum* - commercialize/close source/license your project to your heart's content.

This ensures that changes to the Spectrum library are available to everyone, but puts almost no restrictions on projects that use the library, including closed source and commercial ones.
